# KleanGums - Ronit A. Varun N. Rahul S. Nafisa O.
Our HackKean Project 2018 that won 2nd place overall!

## Inspiration: 
75% of people worldwide have gum disease. Since there was no technology or API to build off of we decided to make our own app to solve a common problem

## What it does: 
It tells a user whether or not they have a gum disease based off of a submitted image.

# Example:
Our app detected that this person will have severe gum disease in the near future:

This person already has gum disease, so our app would return `UNHEALTHY`:

## How we built it - 
We used Android Studios for the front end and Wolfram Technologies for the backend.

## Challenges we ran into - 
Ability to differentiate between different gums and retrieving an image from a Samsung.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of - 
The high success rate our app has of accurately detecting gum disease.

## What we learned - 
How to use Wolfram and integrate Wolfram technologies in our Android Application.

## What's next for KleanGums - 
We plan to expand KleanGums with this Github Respository. Stay tuned for updates!
